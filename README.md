# Say the C

**Say the C** is a simple educational desktop application built with WPF (.NET) to help pupils learn the pronunciation of the letter **C** in various English words.

## Features

- **Random Word Generator**: Shows a random word from the list, containing the letter "C"
- **Speech Support**: Reads the selected word aloud using built-in speech synthesis
- **Visual Highlighting**: Colors the "C" sound based on soft (`Cyan`) or hard (`Red`) pronunciation
- **Instructions Popup**: Displays a guide on how to use the app
  
## How It Works

1. Press **Generate Word!** to get a random word with the letter **C**
2. The app visually highlights the pronunciation:
   - `Soft C` (before `e`, `i`, or `y`) → *Cyan*
   - `Hard C` → *Red*
3. Click the **sound icon** to hear the word spoken aloud
